Very very much work in progress.

## Usage
1. Clone
2. Load as unpacked extension into chrome at chrome://extensions
3. On a page, open dev tools and switch to gRPC tab
4. Load in the protobuf definitions the site uses
5. Refresh the page with the extension open (alternatively open dev tools for the extension (inspector in detached moted)) - most work is in the console
